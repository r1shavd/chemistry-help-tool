# Chemistry Help Tool [Python3]

The python script is made for finding information around the periodic table in chemistry. Created for learning purposes. The script provides with features like listing the entire periodic table elements, finding out the elements using their names or else using their atomic numbers. The script stores the entire periodic table data within itself in lists and dictionaries.

## Note

* The python script is created as a high school computer programming project, thus there would be no more updates to the entire code. Also, this makes sure that you are aware that the code quality of a school student level, and so do not expect that the code quality to be like the ones wriiten off by a senior developer.
* The script can be used by just directly executing it. For the user who wanna do it via terminal, can go to the folder containing the script file (the .py file) and then run the below shown code :
```
python3 script.py
```
